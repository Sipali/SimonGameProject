# Simon Game (HTML • CSS • JavaScript)

A classic memory game built with JS, HTML, and CSS. Repeat the color/sound sequence that grows by one step each round. One wrong press ends the game and shows your final score.

## Features

- Randomly generated sequences with increasing difficulty
- Visual flashes + audio tones per color
- Score/level tracker and Game Over state
- Keyboard and mouse/touch support
- Clean responsive UI (works on desktop & mobile)

## How to Play

1. Press **Start** (or any key if you use the keyboard flow).
2. Watch and listen to the pattern (e.g., Green → Red → Blue…).
3. Click/tap/press keys to repeat the pattern in order.
4. Each round adds a new step. Make a mistake → **Game Over**.
5. Try to beat your best score!
